## Features

- Login: Enter any email address(or what looks like one) and any password(as long as it's not rejected) to login. Login details are saved to LocalStorage.
- Logout: Click on the `Logout` button on the sidebar to logout. This returns you to the login page.
- AuthGuard: To access the main pages of the application, you have to be logged in. This prevents unauthenticated users from accessing the protected pages.
- Fake backend: This serves as the backend server of the application. It currently only serves to authenticate users logging in to the site and should be replaced by a real backend In real life scenarios.
- Table Functionalities: All sorts, paginations, rows to view per page, filters and resets on the table work accordingly.
- The search bar searches items on the datatable and returns rows with values that match the search text.
- Some tests have been set up.
- Login and Logout make use of localstorage.
- The datatable, filters and search box make use of redux for statemanagement.
- A simple `notfound` page is also set up.
